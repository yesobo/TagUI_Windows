// automation flow files start with an URL to tell TagUI where to go

// this flow shows using repositories on Russian social media site VK.com
// for issues or questions, kindly feedback on GitHub or support@tebel.org
// see cheatsheet for steps, conditions, finding element identifiers, etc
// https://github.com/tebelorg/TagUI#cheat-sheet

// please note that in these comments, the symbol ` is replaced with '
// otherwise TagUI will try to interpret it as repository definition

// repositories help to make objects or steps reusable and improve readability
// save repository file with same name as your flow filename and with .csv behind
// repository must have 2 columns, for example below (headers up to you to name)
// using 'object' in your flow replaces it with its definition (which can contain objects)
// for example during execution, 'click link' becomes click //*[@id="profile_full"]//a
// if you have watched Inception movie, this is inception level 2 (capped at max 2 for now)
// don't worry about mistakes, TagUI is usually able to tell you which line has what error

// contents of 5_repositories.csv
// OBJECT,DEFINITION
// email,quick_email
// password,quick_pass
// user_email,mickey_mouse@disney.com
// user_password,iloveminnie4eva
// show info,Show full information
// click link,click 'facebook_link'
// facebook_link,//*[@id="profile_full"]//a

// enough intro, let's go for it
enter `email` as `user_email`
enter `password` as `user_password`

// but we are obviously not going to click Sign up and spam VK
// so let's use some more repository features and go over to FB

// hover and click on the show info link, adding wait to see effect of action
hover `show info`
wait 2.5
click `show info`
wait 2.5

// hover and click on the facebook link, adding wait to see effect of action
hover `facebook_link`
wait 2.5
`click link`
wait

// flow execution output is saved to 5_repositories.log for reference / processing
// for developers and tinkerers, the generated JavaScript file is 5_repositories.js
